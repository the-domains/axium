            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cuba on the Edge of Change</h1><p>at times can feel like a nation abandoned. The aching disrepair of its cities, the untamed foliage of its countryside, the orphaned coastlines - a half-century of isolation has wrapped the country in decay. Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
